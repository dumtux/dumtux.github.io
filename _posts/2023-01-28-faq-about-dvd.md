## What is DVD?

DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc. It is a type of optical disc that is used to store digital data, typically video, audio, and computer data. DVDs have a higher storage capacity than CDs, allowing them to store more information and provide better video and audio quality. They were first introduced in 1996 and are widely used for movies, TV shows, music, and other forms of media.

## Who invented DVD?

The DVD was developed by a group of engineers and companies, known as the DVD Consortium, which consisted of Toshiba, Sony, Time Warner, and others. The development of the DVD began in the late 1980s, as a collaboration between these companies to create a new format for digital video and audio storage that would be an improvement over the VHS tapes and Laserdiscs that were popular at the time.

The DVD format was announced in 1995 and released to the market in 1996. It was quickly adopted by the consumer electronics industry and by the film and music industries, and it quickly became the dominant format for video and audio storage.

It's worth noting that, the format was inspired by the work of several individuals in the field of optical storage, including James Russell who developed the first practical optical storage medium using a blue laser and a transparent substrate.

## what is capacity of DVD?

The storage capacity of a DVD depends on the type of DVD. There are several types of DVDs each with different capacity:

* DVD-5: This is a single-sided, single-layer DVD that has a storage capacity of up to 4.7 GB.
* DVD-9: This is a single-sided, dual-layer DVD that has a storage capacity of up to 8.5 GB.
* DVD-10: This is a double-sided, single-layer DVD that has a storage capacity of up to 9.4 GB.
* DVD-18: This is a double-sided, dual-layer DVD that has a storage capacity of up to 17 GB.
* It's worth mentioning that, the capacity of a DVD is also affected by the data compression method used. Also, the DVD-ROM (read-only) format has the same * capacity as DVD-5 and DVD-9, but it can't be written to.

In comparison, a single-layer Blu-ray disc has a capacity of 25 GB and a dual-layer has 50 GB of storage capacity.

## What laser is used for DVD?

DVDs use a red laser to read and write data to the disc. The red laser has a longer wavelength (650 nanometers) than the blue laser used in Blu-ray discs (405 nanometers), which allows it to read and write data on a disc with a larger land and groove pitch. This enables DVDs to store a larger amount of data than CDs, which use infrared lasers (780 nanometers).

The power of the laser used in a DVD player is typically around 6 to 7 milliwatts. This is a relatively low power level and is safe for use in consumer electronics. The laser beam is focused onto the disc surface through a lens, and the reflected light is then used to read the data stored on the disc. The power of the laser is carefully controlled to ensure that it is strong enough to read the data, but not so strong that it damages the disc or causes eye injury.

## What is the material of DVD?

A DVD is typically made of a polycarbonate plastic substrate, on which a thin metallic layer is deposited. The metallic layer is typically made of aluminum, but it can also be made of gold or silver. This layer is then coated with a photoresistive material, which is sensitive to the laser used to read and write data to the disc. The data is encoded in the disc by etching tiny pits and lands into the metallic layer, which the laser can then read as 1s and 0s. The disc is then coated with a thin layer of plastic to protect the data layer.

## Is DVD rewrittable?

Yes, some DVDs are rewritable, which means that they can be written to and erased multiple times. These types of DVDs are called recordable or rewritable DVDs (DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.).

The DVD-R and DVD+R are write-once formats, meaning that once the data is written to the disc, it cannot be erased or overwritten. While the DVD-RW and DVD+RW are rewritable formats, meaning that the data can be erased and the disc can be used again.

It's worth mentioning that, the rewritable discs have a lower recording quality than their recordable counterparts and their re-recording ability is also limited, they can't be re-recorded over and over again.

It's also worth noting that, like all rewritable media, rewritable DVDs have a limited number of write cycles before they become unreliable.

## Is DVD still in use? What are the alternatives?

While DVD is still in use, it has been largely replaced by newer technologies such as streaming services and USB drives for movie, music and other forms of media storage.

Blu-ray discs which have a higher storage capacity and better video and audio quality than DVDs are still being used for physical media.

In addition, solid-state drives (SSD) and USB flash drives have become increasingly popular for storing data, as they are more durable, have faster read and write speeds, and are more convenient for transporting large amounts of data. Cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud are also widely used as an alternative for storage and sharing of files.

Another alternative, which is becoming more popular, is streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. These allow users to watch movies and TV shows online without the need for physical media.

So, while DVD still have its uses, it has become less popular and being replaced by newer technologies with more advantages.

## Will DVD be used in the future?

It is likely that the use of DVDs will continue to decline in the future as newer technologies like streaming services and solid-state storage become more widely adopted. Streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ have already made it possible for people to watch movies and TV shows online without the need for physical media.

Another factor is that, Blu-ray discs which have a higher storage capacity and better video and audio quality than DVDs are still being used for physical media.

However, DVDs may still have some niche uses in the future, such as in certain industries or for archival purposes. Additionally, there may be some people who prefer physical media over streaming or digital downloads and will continue to use DVDs.

Overall, while DVD will continue to be used in some ways, it's clear that its use will continue to decline as more advanced technology becomes more widely available.
